Unlike existing VPR datasets which provide either viewpoint variation or conidtional variation, ESSEX3IN1 is the first dataset that consists
of images of places that are confusing for both VPR and human-cognition. It contains confusing and challenging dynamic objects, natural
scenes and low-informative frames. Most of the state-of-the-art VPR techniques struggle in catering for these confusing images
as shown in our paper.
